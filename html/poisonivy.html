<h2 class="reports">Poison Ivy by Amy Goldman Koss</h2>

<p class="reports">Poison Ivy by Amy Goldman Koss is a book about a girl named Ivy who is being bullied by a group of girls.<br/> 
On hearing what they were doing, Ivy's teacher decided to host a mock trial to settle the cause.<br/> 
This book shows the same story of the trial from many people's points of view. This book is<br/> confusing
if you skip anything,(I learned that from experience) and talks a lot about court. It has <br/>some bad
words in it, and can be confusing for a younger audience. All in all, this is a good book,<br/> and I hope that you will read it.<br/>By Adam Zaidi</p>
